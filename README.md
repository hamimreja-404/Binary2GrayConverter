Designing a 4-Bit Binary to Gray Code Converter

To kick things off, I've worked on designing a 4-bit binary to Gray code converter. Gray code is a non-weighted, cyclic binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit position, making it useful for minimizing errors in digital systems.

I've shared the complete code, testbenches, and a comprehensive PDF that includes all diagrams and truth tables.

Feel free to check it out, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Let's learn and grow together in the world of digital design!
